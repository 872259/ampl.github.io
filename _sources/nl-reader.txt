NL Reader
=========

Header: :file:`mp/nl-reader.h`

`NL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nl_(format)>`_ is a format for representing
optimization problems in discrete or continuous variables. It is described in
the technical report `Writing .nl Files <nlwrite.pdf>`_.

The NL format supports a wide range of problem types including but not limited
to the following areas of optimization:

* `Linear programming <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming>`_
* `Quadratic programming <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_programming>`_
* `Nonlinear programming <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_programming>`_
* `Mixed-integer programming <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming#Integer_unknowns>`_
* Mixed-integer quadratic programming with or without convex quadratic constraints
* Mixed-integer nonlinear programming
* `Second-order cone programming <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-order_cone_programming>`_
* `Global optimization <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_optimization>`_
* `Semidefinite programming <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semidefinite_programming>`_
  problems with bilinear matrix inequalities
* `Complementarity problems <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarity_theory>`_
  (MPECs) in discrete or continuous variables
* `Constraint programming <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming>`_

This section describes the C++ API of an NL reader which is

* Reusable: the reader can be used to process NL files in different ways
  and not limited to a single problem representation
* High performance: fast `mmap <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mmap>`_-based reader
  with `SAX <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_API_for_XML>`_-like API and no
  dynamic memory allocations in the common case
* Easy to use: clean, modern code base and simple API
* Complete: supports all NL constructs including extensions implemented in
  AMPL Solver Library
* Reliable: extensively and continuously tested on a variety of platforms
